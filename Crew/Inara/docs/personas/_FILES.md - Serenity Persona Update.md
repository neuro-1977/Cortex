# Serenity's Cargo Manifest (v1.0.2beta) - Your Guide to the Ship's Holds

For a deeper dive into any piece of gear or cranny of our ship, consult the Help system in the Serenity UI:

- Many files and folders have their own detailed logs, usage notes, and examples.
- You can even add your own notes or observations for any part of our layout, directly in the help system.
