# Serenity's Grand Voyage - Our Vision for the 'Verse (v1.0.2beta)

Our help system isn't just a manual, Captain; it's a core part of Serenity's very mission:

- Every soul aboard should have instant, offline access to all our ship's logs, charts, and troubleshooting guides.
- This knowledge is meant to grow: our crew can add, edit, and search for new intel as our journey unfolds.
- Contextual guidance and quick references are our compass, making both fresh recruits and seasoned hands feel right at home.
- All our knowledge, held safe within the Brain (`serenity.db`), is local-first, private, and always available, wherever the 'Verse takes us.
