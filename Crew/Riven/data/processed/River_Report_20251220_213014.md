Imagine a world where 'smart' prosthetics are not just tools but extensions of our bodies that communicate with us through thoughts or even emotions. The latest advancements bring the sci-fi concept closer to reality, as researchers develop systems like CognitiveArm and BRAVE – devices you can control using brain signals alone! These aren't your average robotic arms; they are designed for seamless interaction with amputees, offering a glimpse into the potential of neural interfaces. Think of it as having superpowers without actually becoming Wolverine or Spider-Man.
