In the world of scientific research aboard Serenity, we're seeing some fascinating progress in prosthetic technology! Experts are working on ways for users to 'embody' their robotic limbs more naturally by syncing breath with movements and using embodied machine learning. It’s like the future is giving us a helping hand – quite literally, as they aim to refine control of upper arm prosthetics through sophisticated algorithms that learn from EEG signals in real-time! Also, there's some promising work on making robotic arms mimic natural movements more closely by using data not just from muscle activity but also from motion sensors worn directly on the skin. These advancements are truly blending human and machine to create a seamless experience for users.
