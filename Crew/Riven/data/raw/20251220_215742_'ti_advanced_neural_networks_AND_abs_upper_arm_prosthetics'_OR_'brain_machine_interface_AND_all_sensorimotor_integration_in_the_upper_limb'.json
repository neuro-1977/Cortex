    "title": "Discovering gravitational waveform distortions from lensing: a deep dive into GW231123",
    "summary": "Gravitational waves (GWs) are unique messengers as they travel through the Universe without alteration except for gravitational lensing. Their long wavelengths make them susceptible to diffraction by cosmic structures, providing an unprecedented opportunity to map dark matter substructures. Identifying lensed events requires the analysis of thousands to millions of simulated events to reach high statistical significances. This is computationally prohibitive with standard GW parameter estimation methods. We build on top of state-of-the-art neural posterior algorithms to accelerate the lensed inference from CPU days to minutes with DINGO-lensing. We showcase its capabilities by reanalyzing GW231123, the most promising lensed candidate so far, and find that its statistical significance cannot exceed 4$\u03c3$. We observe that 8% of GW231123-like nonlensed simulations favor lensing, which could be explained by the self-similarity of short-duration signals. Still, 58% of GW231123-like lensed simulations have larger support for lensing, showing that higher detection statistics are possible. Although GW231123 exposes the challenges of claiming the first GW lensing detection, our deep-learning methods have demonstrated to be powerful enough to enable the upcoming discovery of lensed GWs.",

    "title": "Instant Expressive Gaussian Head Avatar via 3D-Aware Expression Distillation",
    "summary": "Portrait animation has witnessed tremendous quality improvements thanks to recent advances in video diffusion models. However, these 2D methods often compromise 3D consistency and speed, limiting their applicability in real-world scenarios, such as digital twins or telepresence. In contrast, 3D-aware facial animation feedforward methods -- built upon explicit 3D representations, such as neural radiance fields or Gaussian splatting -- ensure 3D consistency and achieve faster inference speed, but come with inferior expression details. In this paper, we aim to combine their strengths by distilling knowledge from a 2D diffusion-based method into a feed-forward encoder, which instantly converts an in-the-wild single image into a 3D-consistent, fast yet expressive animatable representation. Our animation representation is decoupled from the face's 3D representation and learns motion implicitly from data, eliminating the dependency on pre-defined parametric models that often constrain animation capabilities. Unlike previous computationally intensive global fusion mechanisms (e.g., multiple attention layers) for fusing 3D structural and animation information, our design employs an efficient lightweight local fusion strategy to achieve high animation expressivity. As a result, our method runs at 107.31 FPS for animation and pose control while achieving comparable animation quality to the state-of-the-art, surpassing alternative designs that trade speed for quality or vice versa.

    "title": "Cartesian-nj: Extending e3nn to Irreducible Cartesian Tensor Product and Contracion",
    "summary": "Equivariant atomistic machine learning models have brought substantial gains in both extrapolation capability and predictive accuracy. Depending on the basis of the space, two distinct types of irreducible representations are utilized. From architectures built upon spherical tensors (STs) to more recent formulations employing irreducible Cartesian tensors (ICTs), STs have remained dominant owing to their compactness, elegance, and theoretical completeness. Nevertheless, questions have persisted regarding whether ST constructions are the only viable design principle, motivating continued development of Cartesian networks. In this work, we introduce the Cartesian-3j and Cartesian-nj symbol, which serve as direct analogues of the Wigner-3j and Wigner-nj symbol defined for tensor coupling. These coefficients enable the combination of any two ICTs into a new ICT. Building on this foundation, we extend e3nn to support irreducible Cartesian tensor product, and we release the resulting Python package as cartnn. Within this framework, we implement Cartesian counterparts of MACE, NequIP, and Allegro, allowing the first systematic comparison of Cartesian and spherical models to assess whether Cartesian formulations may offer advantages under specific conditions. Using TACE as a representative example, we further examine whether architectures constructed from irreducible Cartesian tensor product and contraction(ICTP and ICTC) are conceptually well-founded in Cartesian space and whether opportunities remain for improving their design.",

    "title": "PolaRiS: Scalable Real-to-Sim Evaluations for Generalist Robot Policies",
    "summary": "A significant challenge for robot learning research is our ability to accurately measure and compare the performance of robot policies. Benchmarking in robotics is historically challenging due to the stochasticity, reproducibility, and time-consuming nature of real-world rollouts. This challenge is exacerbated for recent generalist policies, which has to be evaluated across a wide variety of scenes and tasks. Evaluation in simulation offers a scalable complement to real world evaluations, but the visual and physical domain gap between existing simulation benchmarks and the real world has made them an unreliable signal for policy improvement. Furthermore, building realistic and diverse simulated environments has traditionally required significant human effort and expertise. To bridge the gap, we introduce Policy Evaluation and Environment Reconstruction in Simulation (PolaRiS), a scalable real-to-sim framework for high-fidelity simulated robot evaluation. PolaRiS utilizes neural reconstruction methods to turn short video scans of real-world scenes into interactive simulation environments. Additionally, we develop a simple simulation data co-training recipe that bridges remaining real-to-sim gaps and enables zero-shot evaluation in unseen simulation environments. Through extensive paired evaluations between simulation and the real world, we demonstrate that PolaRiS evaluations provide a much stronger correlation to real world generalist policy performance than existing simulated benchmarks. Its simplicity also enables rapid creation of diverse simulated environments. As such, this work takes a step towards distributed and democratized evaluation for the next generation of robotic foundation models.",

    "title": "On the Universal Representation Property of Spiking Neural Networks",
    "summary": "Inspired by biology, spiking neural networks (SNNs) process information via discrete spikes over time, offering an energy-efficient alternative to the classical computing paradigm and classical artificial neural networks (ANNs). In this work, we analyze the representational power of SNNs by viewing them as sequence-to-sequence processors of spikes, i.e., systems that transform a stream of input spikes into a stream of output spikes. We establish the universal representation property for a natural class of spike train functions. Our results are fully quantitative, constructive, and near-optimal in the number of required weights and neurons. The analysis reveals that SNNs are particularly well-suited to represent functions with few inputs, low temporal complexity, or compositions of such functions. The latter is of particular interest, as it indicates that deep SNNs can efficiently capture composite functions via a modular design. As an application of our results, we discuss spike train classification. Overall, these results contribute to a rigorous foundation for understanding the capabilities and limitations of spike-based neuromorphic systems.",

    "title": "Sequencing to Mitigate Catastrophic Forgetting in Continual Learning",
    "summary": "To cope with real-world dynamics, an intelligent system needs to incrementally acquire, update, and exploit knowledge throughout its lifetime. This ability, known as Continual learning, provides a foundation for AI systems to develop themselves adaptively. Catastrophic forgetting is a major challenge to the progress of Continual Learning approaches, where learning a new task usually results in a dramatic performance drop on previously learned ones. Many approaches have emerged to counteract the impact of CF. Most of the proposed approaches can be categorized into five classes: replay-based, regularization-based, optimization-based, representation-based, and architecture-based. In this work, we approach the problem from a different angle, specifically by considering the optimal sequencing of tasks as they are presented to the model. We investigate the role of task sequencing in mitigating CF and propose a method for determining the optimal task order. The proposed method leverages zero-shot scoring algorithms inspired by neural architecture search (NAS). Results demonstrate that intelligent task sequencing can substantially reduce CF. Moreover, when combined with traditional continual learning strategies, sequencing offers enhanced performance and robustness against forgetting. Additionally, the presented approaches can find applications in other fields, such as curriculum learning.",

    "title": "Robust CMB B-mode analysis with Needlet-ILC and simulation-based inference",
    "summary": "We explore a novel analysis framework for parameter inference with large-scale CMB polarization data. Our method uses simulation-based inference combined with the needlet internal linear combination (NILC) algorithm and cross-correlation-based statistics to compress the data into a vector that is robust to model misspecification and small enough to be amenable to neural posterior estimation with normalizing flows. By leveraging this compressed data representation, our method enables the robust use of the anisotropic and non-Gaussian information in the foreground fields to more accurately separate the CMB polarization signal from these contaminants. Using an idealized ground-based experimental setup inspired by the Simons Observatory Small Aperture Telescopes, we demonstrate improved statistical constraining power for the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$ compared to the (constrained) NILC algorithm and improved robustness to complex foregrounds compared to other techniques in the literature. Trained on a relatively simple semi-analytical foreground model, the method yields unbiased $r$ results across a range of PySM Galactic foreground simulations, including the high-complexity d12 model, for which we obtain $r=(1.09 \\pm 0.27)\\cdot 10^{-2}$ for input $r=0.01$ and sky fraction $f_{\\mathrm{sky}} = 0.21$. We thus demonstrate the feasibility and advantages of a complete, maps-to-parameters, simulation-based analysis of large-scale CMB polarization for current ground-based observatories.",

    "title": "Semi-Supervised Online Learning on the Edge by Transforming Knowledge from Teacher Models",
    "summary": "Edge machine learning (Edge ML) enables training ML models using the vast data distributed across network edges. However, many existing approaches assume static models trained centrally and then deployed, making them ineffective against unseen data. To address this, Online Edge ML allows models to be trained directly on edge devices and updated continuously with new data. This paper explores a key challenge of Online Edge ML: \"How to determine labels for truly future, unseen data points\". We propose Knowledge Transformation (KT), a hybrid method combining Knowledge Distillation, Active Learning, and causal reasoning. In short, KT acts as the oracle in active learning by transforming knowledge from a teacher model to generate pseudo-labels for training a student model. To verify the validity of the method, we conducted simulation experiments with two setups: (1) using a less stable teacher model and (2) a relatively more stable teacher model. Results indicate that when a stable teacher model is given, the student model can eventually reach its expected maximum performance. KT is potentially beneficial for scenarios that meet the following circumstances: (1) when the teacher's task is generic, which means existing pre-trained models might be adequate for its task, so there will be no need to train the teacher model from scratch; and/or (2) when the label for the student's task is difficult or expensive to acquire.",

    "title": "A survey of the orienteering problem: model evolution, algorithmic advances, and future directions",
    "summary": "The orienteering problem (OP) is a combinatorial optimization problem that seeks a path visiting a subset of locations to maximize collected rewards under a limited resource budget. This article presents a systematic PRISMA-based review of OP research published between 2017 and 2025, with a focus on models and methods that have shaped subsequent developments in the field. We introduce a component-based taxonomy that decomposes OP variants into time-, path-, node-, structure-, and information-based extensions. This framework unifies classical and emerging variants -- including stochastic, time-dependent, Dubins, Set, and multi-period OPs -- within a single structural perspective. We further categorize solution approaches into exact algorithms, heuristics and metaheuristics, and learning-based methods, with particular emphasis on matheuristics and recent advances in artificial intelligence, especially reinforcement learning and neural networks, which enhance scalability in large-scale and information-rich settings. Building on this unified view, we discuss how different components affect computational complexity and polyhedral properties and identify open challenges related to robustness, sustainability, and AI integration. The survey thus provides both a consolidated reference for existing OP research and a structured agenda for future theoretical and applied work.",

    "title": "Identification and efficient estimation of compliance and network causal effects in cluster-randomized trials",
    "summary": "Treatment noncompliance is pervasive in infectious disease cluster-randomized trials. Although all individuals within a cluster are assigned the same treatment condition, the treatment uptake status may vary across individuals due to noncompliance. We propose a semiparametric framework to evaluate the individual compliance effect and network assignment effect within principal stratum exhibiting different patterns of noncompliance. The individual compliance effect captures the portion of the treatment effect attributable to changes in treatment receipt, while the network assignment effect reflects the pure impact of treatment assignment and spillover among individuals within the same cluster. Unlike prior efforts which either empirically identify or interval identify these estimands, we characterize new structural assumptions for nonparametric point identification. We then develop semiparametrically efficient estimators that combine data-adaptive machine learning methods with efficient influence functions to enable more robust inference. Additionally, we introduce sensitivity analysis methods to study the impact under assumption violations, and apply the proposed methods to reanalyze a cluster-randomized trial in Kenya that evaluated the impact of school-based mass deworming on disease transmission.",
