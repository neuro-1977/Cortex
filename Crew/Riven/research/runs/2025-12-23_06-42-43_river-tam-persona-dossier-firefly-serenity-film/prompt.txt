Create a River Research dossier run.

RUN TOPIC: River Tam persona dossier (Firefly + Serenity film)
- If anything is uncertain, say so explicitly.
- Do not output long verbatim passages.
- Output JSON following the model schema.

Create a comprehensive, immersive research dataset from the Firefly universe (TV series + movie). Focus on characterization, thematic through-lines, and continuity.

**Primary target:** River Tam — map her evolution (pre-capture → post-Academy trauma → Miranda revelations). Capture:
- cognitive profile and behavior markers
- triggers, tells, and coping behaviors
- relationships (Mal, Simon, Kaylee, Jayne, Inara, Book, Wash, Zoe)
- how her speech changes across key moments

**Also include:** Mal, Inara, Simon, Book (and the crew) as supporting dossiers.

**Timeline:** build an ordered timeline of major events and character beats (episode/film level), flagging uncertainty and continuity gaps.

**Evidence discipline:** for each claim, include at least one evidence pointer: episode/film moment or scene description.

**Copyright constraints:**
- Do **not** output full transcripts or long verbatim passages.
- If quoting, keep it very short (<= 90 chars) and only when needed.

**Output:** JSON following the model’s default schema.
