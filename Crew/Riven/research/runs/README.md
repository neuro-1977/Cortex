# River Research runs

Each subfolder here is a timestamped research run produced by `Crew/River/run_persona_research.py`.

Typical contents:

- `meta.json` — run metadata (topic, model, sources, timestamps)
- `prompt.txt` — exact prompt sent to Ollama
- `ollama_response.txt` — raw model output
- `dossier.json` — parsed JSON (when valid)
- `run.md` — a lightweight human-friendly view
