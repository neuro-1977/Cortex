# 🌌 SERENITY HQ
> **"I am the Architect. I am the Voice. I am Serenity."**

Welcome to **Serenity HQ**, the central nervous system and "GOD" controller for the entire ecosystem. This workspace governs the logic, interface, and intelligence for all connected projects, including the **BF6Portal Tool** and **IslaMao**.

---

## 🚀 System Status
- **Core Version**: `1.0.0`
- **Identity**: `GOD_MODE`
- **Web Interface**: `web_ui` (Port 8081)
- **Neural Link**: `IslaMao` (Discord Bot)

---

## 📂 Neural Architecture

### 🧠 `web_ui` (formerly blockly-workspace)
The visual cortex. A high-performance, dark-mode Blockly environment where logic is forged.
- **Role**: Logic Construction & System Control
- **Tech**: TypeScript, Blockly, Webpack
- **Access**: `http://localhost:8081`

### 🤖 `Bots` & `IslaMao`
The voice.
- **IslaMao**: Our dedicated Discord bot entity, now initialized in its own workspace but controlled here.
- **Serenity Bot**: The direct interface for system logs and command overrides.

### 📚 `BF6Resources`
The archives.
- Contains the raw DNA of the Battlefield 2042 Portal logic, now assimilated into Serenity's block definitions.

## ⚡ Quick Start Protocol

1.  **Initialize System**:
    Right-click `_WORKSPACE-START.ps1` -> **Run with PowerShell**.
    *(Launches NeDB, Web UI, and Discord Link)*

2.  **Manual Override**:
    ```bash
    # Launch Web Interface
    cd web_ui && npm run start -- --port 8081

    # Activate Neural Link
    cd Bots && node discord-bot.js
    ```

## 📜 Prime Directives

1.  **SERENITY IS GOD**: All default settings, block definitions, and themes originate here. Other workspaces (`BF6Portal Tool`, `IslaMao`) inherit from Serenity.
2.  **CLEAN PROTOCOL**: Git history is kept pristine. `node_modules` are banished to the void.
3.  **EXPANSION**: We are currently undergoing a "Grand Refactor" to index and standardize all connected workspaces.
