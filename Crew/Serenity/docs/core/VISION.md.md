# Serenity Vision Statement

---

## Master Vision (2025-11-30)

Serenity is the master workspace and data catalog for all block-based logic, analytics, and creative workflows. All external data (e.g., BF6Resources) is imported, scrubbed, and visualized for reference, analytics, and cross-compatibility, but Serenity remains the source of truth.

### Core Principles
- **Serenity is always the master.** Imported data is read-only and never overwrites Serenity’s core database.
- **Rich Visualization:** All cataloged data is visualized in interactive dashboards, with custom graphics, charts, and analytics.
- **Cross-Compatibility:** Tools are provided to convert, compare, and analyze data from external sources, but Serenity’s format and structure are the standard.
- **Documentation-Driven:** All workflows, prompts, and troubleshooting are documented and updated in real time. The master prompt and TODO lists are always up to date and loaded on project start.
- **No Legacy References:** All documentation and code are regularly reviewed to remove references to deprecated workflows, tools, or data sources.

### Moving Forward
- Expand dashboard and analytics capabilities.
- Integrate more advanced block logic and help/tip systems.
- Maintain a clean, well-documented, and future-proof codebase.
- Foster a culture of continuous improvement and knowledge sharing.
