## Completed Milestones

- **`node_modules` Cleanup**: Created a clean, final commit for all the `node_modules` cleanup.
- **Discord Bot (`Serenity_Bot`) Core Implementation**: Implemented command handler, initial commands, channel setup, intelligent log routing, and log spam control. `dotenv` issue resolved and correct guild ID is used.

## Legacy Objectives (Archived)
